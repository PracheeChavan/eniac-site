Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. It was founded 10 years ago in Spain and it has since grown and expanded to other neighboring countries.

Besides offering a wide catalog of products at competitive prices, Eniac provides friendly and professional tech support and consultation to its customers. The warmhearted spirit that thrives with direct contact with the customers is at the roots of the company.

Since the company went public, the investors have been pushing the company to scale up the business and become a big e-commerce player globally. It goes without saying that it is an arduous challenge to do so while retaining the human side of the business, Eniacâ€™s emblem.
